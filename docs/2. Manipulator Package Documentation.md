# Manipulator Package Documentation

This documentation provides instructions on how to use and continue developing the `manipulator` package for launching a simulation in RVIZ.

## ROS2 Packages Installation

Ensure that all existing packages are up to date by running the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt update
```
```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

To install the necessary ROS2 packages, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-joint-state-publisher
sudo apt install ros-humble-joint-state-publisher-gui
sudo apt install ros-humble-xacro
sudo apt install ros-humble-robot-state-publisher
sudo apt install ros-humble-rviz2
```

## Workspace Setup

Create the workspace by running the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ws_manipulator/src
```

## Clone the Manipulator Package

Navigate to the `src` directory of the workspace if not already in it and clone the `manipulator` package:
```bash
cd ws_manipulator/src
git clone https://github.com/mennahfawzy03/ROS2_abb_irb_1600.git
```
Next, to remove all unwanted components of the whole package and isolate the `manipulator` package, open your Files app, go into the `ws_manipulator/src/ROS2_abb_irb_1600` folder and drag the `manipulator` folder into the main `src` directory. Lastly delete the `ROS2_abb_irb_1600` folder so that all that remains is the `manipulator` package within your `src` directory.

## Build the Workspace

After cloning the package, build the workspace:

```bash
cd ws_manipulator
colcon build
```

## Source the Setup File

Source the setup file to overlay this workspace on your environment:

```bash
source ~/ws_manipulator/install/setup.bash
```

## Launch the Simulation

To launch the robot in RVIZ and run the Joint State Publisher to move the robot joints, use the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch manipulator display.launch.py
```
