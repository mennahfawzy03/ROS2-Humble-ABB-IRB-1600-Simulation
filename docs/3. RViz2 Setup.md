# Setting up your RViz2 Simulation 

This section will cover how to set up your robot within RViz2 to load it properly, control it, and save the preferred configuration.

### Launching RViz2
To launch the simulation run the following command: 
```bash
ros2 launch manipulator display.launch.py
```
### Setting up the Robot Model 
Within RViz2, on the bottom right-hand side of your screen, click on the `Add` button and select `RobotModel`. Open up the `RobotModel` folder on the left. Next to `Description Topic` chose `/robot_description`. This will load the robot into the simulation. Next, under `Global Options` find the `Fixed Frame` and change it from `map` to `base_link`. This should load your final robot model into the simulation.

### Launching the Joint Controller 
When opening RViz2, automatically a joint controller will open. The Joint State Publisher may or may not successfully control the joints. If no movement is seen, close it and open a new tab in your terminal. Run the following command to open the Joint State Publisher:
```bash
ros2 run joint_state_publisher_gui joint_state_publisher_gui
```
There might be some issues that arise with the movement, so you'll possibly have to launch it a few times before the movements starts being visualized.
