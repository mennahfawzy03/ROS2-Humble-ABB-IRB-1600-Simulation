# Setting up your RViz2 Simulation 

This section will cover how to set up your robot within RViz2 to load it properly, control it, and save the preferred configuration.

### Launching RViz2
To launch the simulation, run the following command: 
```bash
ros2 launch manipulator display.launch.py
```
*This command starts RViz2 with the specified launch file from the `manipulator` package, initializing the robot simulation environment.*

### Setting up the Robot Model 
Within RViz2, on the bottom right-hand side of your screen, click on the `Add` button and select `RobotModel`. Open up the `RobotModel` folder on the left.

*This step adds the robot model to the RViz2 environment, allowing you to visualize and interact with it.*

Next to `Description Topic`, choose `/robot_description`.

*Selecting the correct description topic ensures that RViz2 loads the appropriate robot model.*

This will load the robot into the simulation. Next, under `Global Options`, find the `Fixed Frame` and change it from `map` to `base_link`. This should load your final robot model into the simulation.

*Changing the fixed frame to `base_link` sets the reference frame for your robot, ensuring that all movements and visualizations are relative to the robot's base.*

### Launching the Joint Controller 
When opening RViz2, a joint controller will automatically open. The Joint State Publisher may or may not successfully control the joints. If no movement is seen, close it and open a new tab in your terminal. Run the following command to open the Joint State Publisher:
```bash
ros2 run joint_state_publisher_gui joint_state_publisher_gui
```
*This command launches the Joint State Publisher GUI, which allows you to manually control the joints of your robot within the RViz2 environment.*

There might be some issues that arise with the movement, so you might need to launch it a few times before the movements start being visualized.

*Re-launching the joint controller can help resolve any issues with visualizing joint movements in RViz2.*
