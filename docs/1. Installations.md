## ROS 2 Humble Installation on Ubuntu 22.04

To set up ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill on Ubuntu for development, follow these steps:

1. **Set Locale:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
   ```
   *This command updates the package list and installs the `locales` package, which is necessary for setting up language and regional settings.*

   ```bash
   sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
   sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
   export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
   ```
   *These commands generate and set the locale to `en_US.UTF-8`, ensuring that your system uses the correct language settings, which is important for ROS compatibility.*

2. **Add the ROS 2 apt repository:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install software-properties-common
   ```
   *This installs the `software-properties-common` package, which provides an abstraction for managing software repositories.*

   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository universe
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
   ```
   *The first command adds the `universe` repository, which contains community-maintained free and open-source software. The second command installs `curl`, a tool to transfer data from or to a server.*

   ```bash
   sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
   ```
   *This command downloads the ROS 2 GPG key, which is used to authenticate the packages in the repository.*

   ```bash
   echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
   ```
   *This command adds the ROS 2 repository to your systemâ€™s source list, enabling you to install ROS 2 packages directly via `apt`.*

3. **Install Development Tools and ROS Tools:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-flake8-docstrings python3-pip python3-pytest-cov ros-dev-tools
   ```
   *This updates the package list and installs several Python development tools and the `ros-dev-tools` package, which provides tools for ROS development.*

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y python3-flake8-blind-except python3-flake8-builtins python3-flake8-class-newline python3-flake8-comprehensions python3-flake8-deprecated python3-flake8-import-order python3-flake8-quotes python3-pytest-repeat python3-pytest-rerunfailures
   ```
   *These are additional `flake8` plugins for Python code linting, which help enforce coding standards.*

   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install -U flake8-blind-except flake8-builtins flake8-class-newline flake8-comprehensions flake8-deprecated flake8-import-order flake8-quotes "pytest>=5.3" pytest-repeat pytest-rerunfailures
   ```
   *This command installs or upgrades these `flake8` plugins and testing tools using `pip`, Python's package installer.*

4. **Get ROS 2 Code:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/ros2_humble/src
   ```
   *This creates a directory named `ros2_humble/src` where the ROS 2 source code will be stored.*

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_humble
   vcs import --input https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/humble/ros2.repos src
   ```
   *This navigates to the `ros2_humble` directory and imports the ROS 2 repositories using `vcs`, a tool for working with multiple repositories.*

5. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```
   *This upgrades all installed packages to their latest versions.*

   ```bash
   sudo rosdep init
   ```
   *This initializes `rosdep`, a command-line tool for installing system dependencies.*

   ```bash
   rosdep update
   ```
   *This updates the `rosdep` database with the latest dependency information.*

   ```bash
   rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -y --skip-keys "fastcdr rti-connext-dds-6.0.1 urdfdom_headers"
   ```
   *This installs the dependencies for the ROS 2 source code located in the `src` directory, excluding certain packages specified with `--skip-keys`.*

6. **Build the Workspace:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_humble/
   colcon build --symlink-install
   ```
   *This navigates to the workspace and builds the ROS 2 packages using `colcon`, a command-line tool for building sets of software packages.*

7. **Environment Setup:**
   ```bash
   . ~/ros2_humble/install/local_setup.bash
   ```
   *This sources the setup script to configure your environment to use the newly built ROS 2 packages.*

8. **Try an Example:**
   In one terminal:
   ```bash
   . ~/ros2_humble/install/local_setup.bash
   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
   ```
   *This runs the `talker` node from the `demo_nodes_cpp` package, which publishes messages.*

   In another terminal:
   ```bash
   . ~/ros2_humble/install/local_setup.bash
   ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
   ```
   *This runs the `listener` node from the `demo_nodes_py` package, which subscribes to messages and prints them.*

For further details, follow the instructions from the [ROS 2 Humble Ubuntu Development Setup Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Alternatives/Ubuntu-Development-Setup.html).

## Blender Installation
Blender is a powerful open-source software used for 3D creation. It is capable of modeling, sculpting, animation, rendering, and more. In this setup, Blender will be used to visualize STL files, scale down large STL meshes, ensure they are correctly scaled, and verify the position of the meshes to know what translation is needed.

Blender was installed from [blender.org](https://www.blender.org/download/). After downloading Blender, unzip the downloaded file and extract all files into your home directory (or any other preferred directory). Open the application by launching the Blender application from your Files App.

## Gazebo Installation
Gazebo is already included within the ROS 2 package installed earlier. However, to be able to run Gazebo and open it, you'll have to install the command first using the following:
```bash
sudo apt install gazebo
```
*This installs the Gazebo simulator, which is used for robot simulation.*

Now, you can open Gazebo by simply running `gazebo` in your terminal.
