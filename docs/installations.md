Blender is a powerful open-source software used for 3D creation. It is capable of modeling, sculpting, animation, rendering, and more. In this setup, Blender will be used to visualize STL files, scale down large STL meshes, ensure they are correctly scaled, and verify the position of the meshes to know what translation is needed.
